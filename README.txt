In order to get the virtual experience working you need to be able to upload the world yourself through Unity and then access it through VRChat once it is uploaded.

an account on VRChat is required to upload a world, and your user rank must be at least new user.

within the project itself you can test it in desktop by pressing play at the top.

if you can upload the world, you must click VRChat SDK at the top of the screen, then click open Control Panel, in the control panel log into your account
then go to build, if there are any errors click auto fix, giv the world a name and description and then tick the online publishing box and press build and upload.

once the world is uploaded you can log into vrchat and go to the worlds section in your menu, click my uploads, find the world you uploaded and visit world.
